# ft_printf 42 (100/125)


# ðŸ’¡ About the project

ft_printf is a project that mimics the real printf function.Although wide in scope, itâ€™s not a difficult project.
 You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.
 
 Conversions to handle: csdiupxX%
 
 Value to return: length of the printed string (int).
 
 Since we need to print stuff, we will use the function write() extensively in this project. Remember that write() is a function of type int that returns the number of characters printed out.
This could be useful for printf return value
